Autonomous Driving / Perception Projects
Domain Adaptation from Simulation to Reality

Train a model on CARLA (simulated data) and test it on KITTI (real-world data).


Final Project and Presentation: Vehicular Technology Project
Objective
The main goal of this project is to explore object tagging in video footage and to investigate how parallel object detection across multiple patches can enhance the identification of smaller objects within a larger image. This process should maintain the overall resolution of the image. Alternatively, you may select any one of the tasks outlined in the task overview below.
